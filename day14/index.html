    // We copy the value of `year` to this `thisYear`.
    var year = 2017;
    var thisYear = year;
    //
    //
    // If we change the value of `year` to something else,
    // then nothing happens to `thisYear`.
    year = 2016;
    console.log(year);
    console.log(thisYear);
    //
    //
    // The same thing goes to boolean and string values.
    var name = 'Robert';
    var hisName = name;
    var right = true;
    var left = right;
    //
    name = 'James';
    right = false;

    // Let's say we have an array.
    var players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    //
    // We try to make a copy of array the same way we
    // copy numbers, booleans, and strings.
    var team = players;
    //
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[0] = 'Pop';
    //
    // However what happens when we update that array?
    console.log('Expecting that `var team = players;` will copy the array.')
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    console.log(`It is ${players == team} that both share the same memory.`)
    console.log('\n');
    //
    // Now here is the problem!
    // We have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    // They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //
    //
    // 1. Old fashioned way.
    var team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = "James";
    console.log('Using [].slice.')
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(`It is ${players == team2} that both share the same memory.`)
    console.log('\n');
    //
    // 2. Create a new array and concat the old one in.
    var team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = "Rooling Stone";
    console.log('Using [].concat.')
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team3);
    console.log(`It is ${players == team3} that both share the same memory.`)
    console.log('\n');
    //
    // 3. Use the new ES6 Spread.
    var team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = "Guardian";
    console.log('Using [...spread].')
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(`It is ${players == team4} that both share the same memory.`)
    console.log('\n');
    //
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object.
    var person = {
      name: "Dudung",
      lastName: "Stevenson"
    };
    //
    // Object and Array act the same way when it comes to copying its own
    // properties. So this kind of statement is completely wrong
    //
    // var newPerson = person;
    //
    // 1.  Copy properties with Object.assign
    var newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {isHandsome: false});
    //
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread.
    //
    // var newPerson = {...person} // its next generation of EcmaScript
    //
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and
    // Objects. Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice
    // before using it.
